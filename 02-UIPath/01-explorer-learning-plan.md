# What can learners expect from Automation Explorer?

This plan covers the essentials needed to get you started as quickly as possible with reading the code, building and running simple automations with Studio. It's also the first step towards becoming an automation professional.

# Where does Automation Explorer fit in the developer’s journey?

Explorer is the first stage. You are not yet a developer after this, but it’s a necessary step.
Let's look closer at how the journey towards becoming an automation developer looks like:


1. Become an Associate Automation Developer

This stage means you're able to create effective processes or workflows to be integrated in larger projects by senior Automation Developers. To reach this stage, you must complete the Automation Explorer and Automation Developer Associate learning path, gain some experience by working on a few implementation projects, then pass the Associate Certification exam.


2. Become a Professional Automation Developer

This stage means that you can create complex projects on your own using the Robotic Enterprise Framework. To reach this stage, you must complete the Automation Explorer, Automation Developer Associate, and Automation Developer Professional learning plans. Next, you should gain some experience by implementing a few projects. Lastly, take the Advanced Automation Developer exam to certify your skills.


3. Be a continuous learner. The purpose of continuous education can be to gain a better understanding of different features or products and to become specialized in them.

There are several areas of specialization you can explore at this level of knowledge. For example, you can focus on Document Understanding with AI Center and become an Automation Developer Document Understanding specialist, or focus on the UiPath testing capabilities and become an Automation Developer Application Testing specialist.

# What is automation?

Automation, in its essence, involves **leveraging technology, software, or machinery to carry out tasks that would typically require human effort**. The beauty of automation lies in its ability to minimize or eliminate the need for constant human intervention, allowing processes to run smoothly and efficiently.
