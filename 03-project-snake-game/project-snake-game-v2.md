# Warming up the LLM

I created a **new chat** and tried to change my prompt to ask it to describe the steps needed to build a snake game, this essentially **warms up** the LLM, it helps set the landscape if you like. 

**We want to use a new chat because previous parts of the conversation will influence the output.** 

```prompt

Creating a snake game in Python is a classic programming exercise that allows you to practice various concepts such as game loops, event handling, and data structures. Here are the different steps to create a snake game in Python:

1. **Set up the game environment**:
   - Import the necessary Python modules, such as `pygame` or `turtle`, for creating the game window and handling graphics.
   - Initialize the game window and set its dimensions.

2. **Define the game components**:
   - Create a data structure (e.g., a list or a class) to represent the snake's body.
   - Define the initial position and size of the snake.
   - Create a data structure to represent the food (or treat) that the snake will eat.
   - Initialize the game score to zero.

3. **Implement the game loop**:
   - Set up the main game loop that will continuously run until the game ends.
   - Handle user input (e.g., arrow keys) to control the snake's movement.
   - Update the snake's position based on the user input.
   - Check for collisions (e.g., with walls or the snake's body).

4. **Draw the game elements**:
   - Clear the game window before each frame.
   - Draw the snake's body (e.g., using rectangles or lines).
   - Draw the food item (e.g., using a square or a circle).
   - Display the game score.

5. **Implement the game logic**:
   - Move the snake's body based on the current direction.
   - Grow the snake's body when it eats the food.
   - Randomly generate a new food item after the snake eats the current one.
   - Update the game score when the snake eats the food.

6. **Handle game over conditions**:
   - Check if the snake collides with a wall or its own body.
   - Display a "Game Over" message or prompt the user to play again.

7. **Enhance the game (optional)**:
   - Add sound effects (e.g., for eating food or colliding).
   - Implement levels with increasing difficulty (e.g., faster snake movement, obstacles).
   - Keep track of high scores and allow the player to enter their name.
   - Add a pause/resume functionality.

Here's a basic structure of the game loop in Python using the `pygame` module:

```python
import pygame

# Initialize Pygame
pygame.init()

# Set up the game window
window_width = 800
window_height = 600
window = pygame.display.set_mode((window_width, window_height))
pygame.display.set_caption("Snake Game")

# Define game components
snake_position = [100, 100]
snake_body = [[100, 100], [90, 100], [80, 100]]
food_position = [300, 300]
game_over = False

# Game loop
while not game_over:
    # Handle events
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            game_over = True

    # Update game state
    # (e.g., move the snake, check for collisions, update score)

    # Draw game elements
    window.fill((0, 0, 0))  # Clear the window
    for position in snake_body:
        pygame.draw.rect(window, (0, 255, 0), (position[0], position[1], 10, 10))
    pygame.draw.rect(window, (255, 0, 0), (food_position[0], food_position[1], 10, 10))
    pygame.display.update()

# Quit Pygame
pygame.quit()
```

This code snippet demonstrates the basic structure of the game loop, including handling events, updating the game state, and drawing the snake and food on the screen. You can further extend this code by adding the missing functionality for movement, collision detection, score tracking, and other features.

# Now to ask the LLM to use it's own description to build a new game

```prompt
provide the code for a snake game in python, the code should include all the details and features described above.
```

Sure, here's a complete Python code for a basic snake game with various features such as movement, collision detection, score tracking, and game over condition. This implementation uses the `pygame` module for graphics and event handling:

```python
import pygame
import random

# Initialize Pygame
pygame.init()

# Set up the game window
window_width = 800
window_height = 600
window = pygame.display.set_mode((window_width, window_height))
pygame.display.set_caption("Snake Game")

# Define colors
black = (0, 0, 0)
green = (0, 255, 0)
red = (255, 0, 0)

# Define game components
snake_position = [100, 100]
snake_body = [[100, 100], [90, 100], [80, 100]]
food_position = [random.randrange(1, (window_width // 10)) * 10, random.randrange(1, (window_height // 10)) * 10]
food_spawned = True
direction = 'RIGHT'
change_to = direction
score = 0

# Define game clock
clock = pygame.time.Clock()

# Game loop
game_over = False
while not game_over:
    # Handle events
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            game_over = True
        elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            if event.key == pygame.K_LEFT and change_to != 'RIGHT':
                change_to = 'LEFT'
            elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT and change_to != 'LEFT':
                change_to = 'RIGHT'
            elif event.key == pygame.K_UP and change_to != 'DOWN':
                change_to = 'UP'
            elif event.key == pygame.K_DOWN and change_to != 'UP':
                change_to = 'DOWN'

    # Update game state
    if change_to == 'LEFT' and direction != 'RIGHT':
        direction = 'LEFT'
    elif change_to == 'RIGHT' and direction != 'LEFT':
        direction = 'RIGHT'
    elif change_to == 'UP' and direction != 'DOWN':
        direction = 'UP'
    elif change_to == 'DOWN' and direction != 'UP':
        direction = 'DOWN'

    # Move the snake
    if direction == 'LEFT':
        snake_position[0] -= 10
    elif direction == 'RIGHT':
        snake_position[0] += 10
    elif direction == 'UP':
        snake_position[1] -= 10
    elif direction == 'DOWN':
        snake_position[1] += 10

    # Insert the new head position at the beginning of the snake body
    snake_body.insert(0, list(snake_position))

    # Check for food collision
    if snake_position[0] == food_position[0] and snake_position[1] == food_position[1]:
        food_spawned = False
        score += 10
    else:
        snake_body.pop()

    # Spawn new food
    if not food_spawned:
        food_position = [random.randrange(1, (window_width // 10)) * 10, random.randrange(1, (window_height // 10)) * 10]
        food_spawned = True

    # Draw game elements
    window.fill(black)
    for position in snake_body:
        pygame.draw.rect(window, green, (position[0], position[1], 10, 10))
    pygame.draw.rect(window, red, (food_position[0], food_position[1], 10, 10))
    pygame.display.set_caption(f"Snake Game | Score: {score}")
    pygame.display.update()

    # Check for collisions
    for body_part in snake_body[1:]:
        if snake_position[0] == body_part[0] and snake_position[1] == body_part[1]:
            game_over = True
            break

    # Check for wall collisions
    if (
        snake_position[0] < 0
        or snake_position[0] > window_width - 10
        or snake_position[1] < 0
        or snake_position[1] > window_height - 10
    ):
        game_over = True

    # Set the game speed
    clock.tick(15)

# Quit Pygame
pygame.quit()
```

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The game components are initialized, including the snake's position, body, food position, direction, score, and game clock.
2. The game loop continuously runs until the `game_over` condition is met.
3. User input is handled through the `pygame.KEYDOWN` event, allowing the player to change the snake's direction.
4. The snake's position is updated based on the current direction.
5. The snake's body is updated by inserting the new head position at the beginning and removing the last position if the snake hasn't eaten food.
6. Food collision is checked, and if the snake eats the food, the score is incremented, and a new food position is generated.
7. The game elements (snake body and food) are drawn on the window using `pygame.draw.rect`.
8. Collisions with the snake's body and walls are checked, and the `game_over` condition is set accordingly.
9. The game speed is controlled using `clock.tick(15)`, which limits the frame rate to 15 frames per second.

This code covers the basic functionality of a snake game, including movement, collision detection, score tracking, and game over condition. You can further enhance the game by adding additional features such as sound effects, levels, high scores, and a pause/resume functionality.

**Have to admit, that is flipping amazing**

This seems to work perfectly from my testing. It's significantly better than the last time I tried to build my own python based snake game, that's for sure!!
