Building a Tic Tac Toe game in Python involves several steps. Here's a breakdown of the main steps you'll need to follow:

1. **Set up the game board**
   - Create a data structure to represent the game board, such as a list of lists or a dictionary.
   - Initialize the board with empty cells (e.g., ' ' or '-').

2. **Define the player moves**
   - Create a function to handle player moves.
   - Prompt the user to input the row and column indices for their move.
   - Check if the chosen cell is empty and update the board accordingly.

3. **Display the game board**
   - Create a function to display the current state of the game board.
   - Use loops and string formatting to print the board in a human-readable format.

4. **Check for a winner**
   - Define a function to check if a player has won the game.
   - Iterate through the rows, columns, and diagonals to check for a winning combination (e.g., three X's or three O's in a row).

5. **Check for a tie**
   - Define a function to check if the game has ended in a tie.
   - If all cells are filled and no player has won, it's a tie.

6. **Game loop**
   - Set up a loop to continue the game until a winner is found or the game ends in a tie.
   - Within the loop, alternate between player moves and checking for a winner or a tie.

7. **User input and validation**
   - Implement input validation to ensure that players enter valid moves.
   - Handle exceptions and provide appropriate error messages.

8. **Main function**
   - Create a main function to initialize the game and call the necessary functions.
   - Prompt the players for their names or symbols (e.g., 'X' and 'O').
   - Display the game instructions.

9. **Play the game**
   - Run the main function to start the game.
   - Allow players to take turns making moves.
   - Display the updated game board after each move.
   - Announce the winner or declare a tie when the game ends.

10. **Additional features (optional)**
    - Implement error handling for invalid inputs.
    - Add a option to play again after the game ends.
    - Enhance the user interface with ASCII art or graphics.
    - Implement different game modes (e.g., single-player against an AI opponent).

This is a high-level overview of the steps involved in building a Tic Tac Toe game in Python. You'll need to implement each function and handle the game logic according to your specific requirements.

Here's a basic example of how the main game loop might look like:
```

```python
def play_game():
    board = initialize_board()
    current_player = 'X'

    while True:
        display_board(board)
        row, col = get_player_move(current_player)
        make_move(board, row, col, current_player)

        if check_winner(board, current_player):
            display_board(board)
            print(f"Player {current_player} wins!")
            break
        elif check_tie(board):
            display_board(board)
            print("It's a tie!")
            break

        current_player = 'O' if current_player == 'X' else 'X'

if __name__ == "__main__":
    play_game()
```

## Now we need to use contect to get it to build the game

    using the steps above, please provide the code for a Tic Tac Toe game built using Python

Sure, here's a basic implementation of a Tic Tac Toe game in Python following the steps we discussed:

```python
def initialize_board():
    """Initialize an empty 3x3 board."""
    return [['-' for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]

def display_board(board):
    """Display the current state of the board."""
    for row in board:
        print(' '.join(row))
    print()

def get_player_move(player):
    """Get the next move from the player."""
    while True:
        row = int(input(f"Player {player}, enter row (0-2): "))
        col = int(input(f"Player {player}, enter column (0-2): "))

        if row < 0 or row > 2 or col < 0 or col > 2:
            print("Invalid move, try again.")
            continue

        if board[row][col] != '-':
            print("That cell is already occupied, try again.")
            continue

        return row, col

def make_move(board, row, col, player):
    """Make a move on the board."""
    board[row][col] = player

def check_winner(board, player):
    """Check if a player has won the game."""
    # Check rows
    for row in board:
        if all(cell == player for cell in row):
            return True

    # Check columns
    for col in range(3):
        if all(board[row][col] == player for row in range(3)):
            return True

    # Check diagonals
    if all(board[i][i] == player for i in range(3)):
        return True
    if all(board[i][2 - i] == player for i in range(3)):
        return True

    return False

def check_tie(board):
    """Check if the game has ended in a tie."""
    for row in board:
        if '-' in row:
            return False
    return True

def play_game():
    """Play the Tic Tac Toe game."""
    board = initialize_board()
    current_player = 'X'

    while True:
        display_board(board)
        row, col = get_player_move(current_player)
        make_move(board, row, col, current_player)

        if check_winner(board, current_player):
            display_board(board)
            print(f"Player {current_player} wins!")
            break
        elif check_tie(board):
            display_board(board)
            print("It's a tie!")
            break

        current_player = 'O' if current_player == 'X' else 'X'

if __name__ == "__main__":
    play_game()
```

Here's how the game works:

1. The `initialize_board()` function creates an empty 3x3 board represented as a list of lists.
2. The `display_board(board)` function prints the current state of the board.
3. The `get_player_move(player)` function prompts the current player to enter a row and column for their move. It validates the input and ensures that the chosen cell is empty.
4. The `make_move(board, row, col, player)` function updates the board with the player's move.
5. The `check_winner(board, player)` function checks if the current player has won the game by checking rows, columns, and diagonals.
6. The `check_tie(board)` function checks if the game has ended in a tie (all cells are filled and no winner).
7. The `play_game()` function is the main game loop that alternates between player moves, checks for a winner or a tie, and updates the current player.
8. The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block calls the `play_game()` function to start the game.

To play the game, run the script, and follow the prompts to enter your moves. The game will continue until a winner is found or it ends in a tie.

Note: This is a basic implementation, and you can enhance it further by adding features like error handling, replay option, AI opponent, and a more user-friendly interface.
